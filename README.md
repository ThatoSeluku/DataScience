# DataScience Repository

Welcome to my **DataScience** repository! This is a space where I document my journey in data science, consolidate resources, and work on various projects to improve my skills and knowledge.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

### 1. **Resources**
   - Books, articles, and tutorials I use to learn concepts and methodologies.
   - Notes and summaries of important topics in data science.

### 2. **Learning Concepts**
   - Jupyter notebooks and scripts for exploring foundational and advanced topics such as:
     - Data wrangling
     - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     - Statistics and probability
     - Machine learning algorithms
     - Deep learning

### 3. **Upskilling**
   - Practice exercises and coding challenges.
   - Implementation of algorithms and techniques.

### 4. **Projects**
   - Beginner Projects: Building foundational understanding and confidence.
   - Intermediate Projects: Applying concepts to solve real-world problems.
   - Advanced Projects: Tackling complex problems, including custom implementations and innovative approaches.

## Current Focus
I am currently focusing on:
- Linear regression (Beginner Project)
- Data visualization techniques
- Feature engineering
