# NLTK Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of Amazon product reviews using two powerful approaches: the **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** model and a pre-trained transformer model, **RoBERTa**. The goal is to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative while exploring the strengths of both models.

## Project Overview

1. **Dataset**
   - Source: Kaggle (Amazon product reviews dataset)
   - The dataset includes text reviews and associated metadata.

2. **Steps**
   - **VADER Sentiment Analysis**:
     - Leverages NLTK's VADER model, a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.
     - Provides initial insights into the sentiment of the reviews.
   - **RoBERTa**:
     - A pre-trained transformer model known for its robust performance in natural language understanding tasks.
     - Used to re-analyze the sentiments, providing a significant improvement over VADER.

3. **Tools and Libraries**
   - **Python**
   - **NLTK**: For VADER implementation
   - **Hugging Face Transformers**: For the RoBERTa model
   - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
   - **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Results
- VADER provides quick and lightweight sentiment analysis but may lack precision on nuanced or complex reviews.
- RoBERTa demonstrates superior performance by capturing contextual information, leading to more accurate sentiment predictions.
